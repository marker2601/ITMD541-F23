        <h2>My Learning Path</h2>
        <p>In my academic sphere, I am a M.Sc student at IIT Chicago, focusing on Information Technology. But my technological journey commenced during my school years, piqued by a fascination towards web pages and nurturing an innate curiosity about how they were created. This journey led to a proficient exploration of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and subsequently, advanced tools like Python, Java, Tableau, OracleDBA, MySQL, and even ventured into machine learning.</p>

        <p>Every coding challenge is a new quest, and my methodology toward problem-solving in coding is multi-faceted. I endeavor to approach the challenge from various perspectives. When faced with a particularly tough one, I give myself a break, only to return with renewed resolve. The crux of the learning process for me is the moment I solve the problem and realize the simplicity of the solution, providing a good-hearted chuckle at the time taken to reach it.</p>

        <p>In this course together, we will walk through the nuances of web development and explore HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript â€“ the triad of web-developing technologies. To ensure a fruitful exchange of knowledge, I encourage active engagement, whether it be clarifying doubts, brainstorming ideas, or sharing insights. Let's commit ourselves to a semester of enriching learning and transforming complex problems into efficient web applications! </p>
        <p>Welcome, to an exciting dive into the world of web development. Let's learn, create and collaborate. Looking forward to a fantastic semester with all of you!</p>
