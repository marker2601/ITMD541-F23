        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            With over seven years of experience in sectors like BPO, Mortgage, and Banking, my journey has been marked by continuous learning and application of data analysis, business analysis, visual modeling, and business process improvements. Away from my profession, I am drawn towards diverse interests including anime series, gaming, cinematography, cosmology, cooking, and nature.</p>

        <p>Web development transcends beyond a field - it's a merger of artistic problem-solving and scientific programming. Paving the path to web development started with an early allure towards web pages and nurtured by HTML learning. I honed my skills in CSS, JavaScript and extended my proficiency to include Python, Java, Tableau, OracleDBA, MySQL, and even dipped my toes into the thrilling arena of machine learning. Every coding challenge is a stimulating quest, solved with an approach that combines patience, varied perspectives, and timely respites. Let's immerse ourselves into a semester of profound learning, as we decode the realms of web development and conquer it!
